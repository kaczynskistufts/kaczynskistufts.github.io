CS120 Lab 4 - Portfolio

For some reason, I felt compelled to style my website after Windows 98. In researching design elements, I found a really cool, existing project: https://jdan.github.io/98.css/ - though I didn't use any CSS from there since that was not allowed. I got the icons from https://win98icons.alexmeub.com and hex codes from https://colorswall.com/palette/102495. I also used https://www.w3schools.com extensively for tutorials.

This site is definitely not perfect, and there are some improvements I'd like to make, such as setting up a grid structure in CSS so I can better control element layout, especially the "windows" that "pop-up." Speaking of those, I'd love to enhance them such that they better replicate Windows 98, as well as by adding a scroll feature within the divs.

I'm looking forward to enhancing this site and have had fun making it (though I spent way too much time and got behind on the other lab because of that).
