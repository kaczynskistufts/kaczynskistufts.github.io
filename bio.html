            <h1>About Me!</h1>
            <p>Hi! My name is Sarah Kaczynski. I'm currently a first year STEM Ed PhD student at Tufts. When I'm not working or 
                doing schoolwork, I enjoy running, crocheting, reading, writing, programming, playing guitar - essentially 
                anything that keeps me active and creative. Some fun facts about me are that I grew up in a log cabin in NH, am 
                a vegetarian, and my favorite animal is the Silkie chicken! I'd love to have chickens again someday, but for now, 
                my roommates and I have a cat named Maple Syrup.
            </p>
